<body>
This code implements a server-client chat application.<br />
<br />
The application includes two packages, {@link chatclient} for the client and {@link chatserver} for the server, which
communicate using Java RMI. Because RMI allows methods of one class to be called by another as if they were local
methods, most of the 'heavy lifting' is done in the server code, with the client simply calling server methods to
accomplish its tasks. Note, however, that because the server must return values to the client when messages are sent to
it and thus must be able to communicate with the client at will, the server must also be able to call methods in the
client. This slightly loosens the client/server dichotomy, as instances of both classes take both roles for different
functions. Details regarding the functionality of the classes individually are included at the package level.<br />
<big><b>Tutorial</b><br /></big>
<b>Compiling the Application:</b> <br />
To compile the code, we first make a JAR of the interface classes. On windows: <br />
cd \CS262Project <br />
javac chatclient\ClientCallback.java chatserver\ChatServer.java <br />
jar cvf chat.jar chatserver\ChatServer.class chatclient\ClientCallback.class <br />
<br />
To build the server class, on windows: <br />
javac -cp chat.jar chatserver\Server.java <br />
<br />
To build the client class, on windows: <br />
javac -cp chat.jar chatclient\Client.java <br />
<br />
<b>Running the Application:</b> <br />
To start the server, first start the rmi registry on the server machine. On windows, assuming port 1999 is usable: <br />
start rmiregistry <br />
If you wish to use a different port, it is specified as the argument to the above command. Now we need to configure
the security policy file. Using the file {@link keno.policy}, change the path to the source directory. Then, to start
the server on Windows<br />

java -cp chat.jar -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:chat.jar -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=hostname -Djava.security.policy=keno.policy server.Server <br />

Then, on the client machine, we can connect to this server by running <br />

java -cp chat.jar -Djava.security.policy=Keno.policy client.ChatClient hostname <br />

The client should then be connected to the server and can begin chatting.<br />
<br />
<b>Using the Chat Server:</b><br />
On connecting, the user supplies an account name for the client. If it does not exist, it is created. If it does exist
and there is an outstanding message queue, the messages are sent to the client. The client can then begin to enter
commands. The valid commands, which are the first term in each of the instructions below, and the corresponding syntax
are <br />
<br />
AddAccount name<br />
ListAccounts<br />
ListGroups<br />
AddGroup name<br />
AddGroupMember name user<br />
Send message<br />
DeleteAccount name<br />
Logout<br />
<br />
The last command entered should be Logout, and then the session ends.<br />
